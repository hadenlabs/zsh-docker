## Module Versioning

This Module follows the principles of [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/).

Using the given version number of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, we apply the following constructs:

1. Use the `MAJOR` version for incompatible changes.
1. Use the `MINOR` version when adding functionality in a backwards compatible manner.
1. Use the `PATCH` version when introducing backwards compatible bug fixes.

### Backwards compatibility in `0.0.z` and `0.y.z` version

- In the context of initial development, backwards compatibility in versions `0.0.z` is **not guaranteed** when `z` is increased. (Initial development)
- In the context of pre-release, backwards compatibility in versions `0.y.z` is **not guaranteed** when `y` is increased. (Pre-release)
